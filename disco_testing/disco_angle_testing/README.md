## Test Script for Angle Calculations
This zephyr test project integrates magnetometer and gyroscope sensor readings to calculate the angle relative to North. It uses sensor fusion to combine the angle and the expected angle (from the gyroscope readings).

This project is designed to be run on the disco_l475_iot1 board.
