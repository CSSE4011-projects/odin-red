## Test Script for TOF Sensor Integration
This zephyr test project attempts to integrate the VL53L1X TOF sensor using zephyr libraries. Slight changes to the code can be made to use the disco's onboard VL53L0X sensor (with full functionality), however it is not yet fully functional with the external VL53L1X.

This project is designed to be run on the disco_l475_iot1 board.
